## 📋 What Changed in Controller

### File Upload Handling

$attachmentPath = storage_path('app/public/' . $storagePath);
```

### Message Sending
```php
// OLD: Direct controller method
$result = $this->sendWhatsAppMessage($user->phone, $message, ...);

// NEW: Using WhatsAppService
$whatsappService = new WhatsAppService();
$result = $whatsappService->sendMessage($user->phone, $message, ...);
```

### Response Handling
```php
// OLD: Simple boolean return
if ($result) { ... }

// NEW: Array with success flag
if ($result['success']) { ... }
```

### AJAX Support
```php
// NEW: JSON response for AJAX
if ($request->ajax()) {
    return response()->json([
        'success' => true,
        'message' => $messageText,
        'stats' => [ ... ]
    ]);
