## 🔍 Important Notes

### Device Connection
⚠️ **Make sure your device is connected to Message API:**

1. Go to https://messagesapi.co.in/dashboard
2. Find the device "Mototrola" (ID: `7e78b0f48d5c4428b3d0cdf70406db2f`)
3. Ensure it shows as "Connected" or "Online"
4. If offline:
   - Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp
   - Or reconnect the device

### Phone Number Format
- The system automatically formats phone numbers
- Adds country code +91 if missing
- Removes special characters
- Final format: `919876543210` (without +)

### Message Personalization
- Always use `[[name]]` for personalization (double brackets)
- Other placeholders can be added in the code if needed
- If a user has no first name, "User" will be used as fallback

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 60 messages per minute
- Maximum 1000 messages per hour

4. **Logging**: All messages are logged for audit purposes
5. **Validation**: Input is sanitized and validated
